# HVAC_Waste_Detection

*This project was developed as part of the Internet of Things course, during my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Bologna.*

I implemented an IoT system that monitors the temperature of an house, to prevent useless HVAC consumption, detecting it by rapid temperature changes.
